# This script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
# on two predefined numbers and prints the results.

# Assign specific values to the two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# --- Perform Arithmetic Operations ---

# Calculate the sum of number1 and number2
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Calculate the difference by subtracting number2 from number1
difference_result = number1 - number2

# Calculate the product of number1 and number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# --- Print the Results ---

# Print the addition result in the specified format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")

# Print the subtraction result in the specified format
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")

# Print the multiplication result in the specified format
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")

# To execute this script:
# 1. Save the code above into a file named 'basic_operations.py'.
# 2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
# 3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
